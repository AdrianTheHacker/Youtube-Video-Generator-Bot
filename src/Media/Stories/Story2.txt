The man behind the Tree.

The man behind the tree, When i moved out of my parent's house at 19 I got into my own dorm. At the start of the month it was going fine, Suddenly until this one night, I hear loud banging on my window, Since my window is beside my bed And my TV In front the banging would be pretty loud. From my perspective. Then the noise started to get louder and seem like its getting more loud by the second. When i finally got the power to stand up and open my blinds.. I didn't believe what i saw, A black figure Almost transparent with a dark Aura Is seen behind this long tree infront of my window With glowing red bloodshot eyes. I don't know how else 
to explain it other than that. When i reported this to the Staff / Workers they didn't believe but other people who lived in the same apartment as me Has also claimed that they saw this person, Or figure before, I moved out 2 months ago, And that memory will never be forgotten.
