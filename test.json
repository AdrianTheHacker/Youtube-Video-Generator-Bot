From my perspective. Then the noise started to get louder and seem like its getting more loud by the second. When i finally got the power to stand up and open my blinds.. I didn't believe what i saw, A black figure Almost transparent with a dark Aura Is seen behind this long tree infront of my window With glowing red bloodshot eyes. I don't know how else to explain it other than that. When i reported this to the Staff / Workers they didn't believe but other people who lived in the same apartment as me Has also claimed that they saw this person, Or figure before, I moved out 2 months ago, And that memory will never be forgotten.",

The second was silent too, but a little louder, and this kept going, until i decided to tell my mom. i opened th porch door and there was a tall, meaty creature, like almost red, i got a short glimpse of the thing before i got terrified and slammed the door shut.\n\ni will probably make an update, but i won´t probably live to tell the rest, the knocking wont stop, and i think i might go insane, so i might as well change home, and\n\nI WILL NOT OPEN THE DOOR EVER AGAIN",

The locals whispered in hushed tones about a dark presence that haunted the town, a spirit known as the Witch. Legends spoke of her malevolent powers and the curse she placed upon anyone who dared to cross her path. Those who encountered her were said to be possessed, forever tormented by her vengeful spirit.\n\null fateful night, a group of curious teenagers decided to investigate the rumours surrounding the Witch. Ignoring the warnings of their elders, they ventured into the depths of the forest, armed with only a lantern and their misguided bravery. As they delved deeper, the air grew heavy with an otherworldly chill, and the once vibrant foliage turned ominously dark.\n\nFinally, they stumbled upon a dilapidated cabin, standing as a stark testament to the Witch's presence. Shrouded in darkness, the teens hesitated, sensing the unseen eyes that watched their every move. Drawn by an inexplicable force, they cautiously entered the decaying structure, their hearts pounding with a mix of excitement and dread.\n\nInside, the air was thick with an acrid smell, and cobwebs clung to every corner. They discovered an ancient book, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and incantations. Unbeknownst to them, this was the key to awakening the Witch's spirit. Driven by curiosity, one of the teenagers, Sarah, couldn't resist the allure of the forbidden text.\n\nAs she traced her finger along the strange symbols, a sudden gust of wind blew through the cabin, extinguishing their lantern and plunging them into total darkness. The terrified teens huddled together, their breaths trembling, as whispers filled the air. Sarah's eyes widened in horror as she realized she had unwittingly summoned the Witch.[full read the article at this link](https: //blogboy260.blogspot.com/2023/06/possession-of-witchs-spirit-2.html)",

            "selftext": "It was June 16th, 2023, just like any other day. But as the day went on, something strange began to occur. The clock struck midnight, and instead of transitioning to June 17th, the day simply reset.\n\nAt first, it was just little things that were off. The same birds chirping outside, the same cars driving by. But as the day repeated itself over and over, it became increasingly clear that something was very wrong.\n\nPeople began to notice that they were stuck in a time loop. Each day was identical to the last, and the more they tried to break the cycle, the more hopeless it seemed. Time seemed to be standing still, and no matter what anyone did, they couldn't escape the repetition.\n\nThe first few days were almost peaceful, as people went about their business as usual, enjoying the sunshine and the lazy summer days. But as the cycle continued, the monotony began to wear on them. People became restless and anxious, desperate for some way to escape the endless repetition.\n\nAs the days wore on, people began to notice strange anomalies in the environment around them. Buildings that had been damaged or destroyed were suddenly intact again. People who had died were walking around as if nothing had happened. It was as if time itself had been rewound, and everyone was stuck in an eternal purgatory.\n\nThe sun never seemed to set, and the days began to blur together in a never-ending cycle of sameness. People began to lose their minds, unable to cope with the endless repetition. Some tried to break the cycle by committing suicide, but even death seemed to offer no escape from the eternal June 16th.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, the situation became increasingly dire. People were starving and dying of thirst, as the same food and water supplies were repeatedly consumed. The world outside of the small town where the loop was centered seemed to have ceased to exist, and the trapped residents were left to fend for themselves in a never-ending nightmare.\n\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, something changed. The clock struck midnight on June 17th, and the day progressed as it should have. The time loop had been broken, and the residents of the town were free once again.\n\nBut the damage had been done. Many had lost their minds, and others were scarred for life by the experience. The town had become a ghost town, its residents scattered to the winds in search of a new life, haunted by the memory of the day that repeated itself over and over again.",

            "selftext": "It may be too late for some of you, but every since I was a child I would get an unsettling feeling every time I would look at my reflection. Just the way it would stare back blankly would give me a feeling of pure dread. It seemed as if it was tired, waiting for it’s opportunity to pounce at me and take my place. This fear took over me at a young age. I would be scared to close a door when I would use the bathroom or take a shower because I thought my reflection would come out and attack me almost like some urban legend. But as I got older I figured, “well it couldn’t really reach through the mirror and grab me, could it?” \n\nWell anyway, after going to college for  4 long, grueling years I became an interior designer and I was told to build a gigantic mansion. I was told that the most important part of the house was the mirrors. They were meant to tower over everyone in the house. They were meant to be 10 feet tall with no dents or marks in them. In every single room there stood at least 12 tall mirrors each showing your reflection with no cracks or handprints visible, Except for one large room with a mirror, even taller than all of the rest, with one massive scratch mark going down the mirror. It made me wonder just what kind of person wanted this house made. But whatever makes them happy, I suppose or so I was told to think. \n\nWhile at lunch, I told my friends and co-workers about my fear of mirrors and they just laughed it off and shrugged as if it was just some irrational fear. This upset me. What if it was some irrational fear? I mean it’s insane to think that there is a clone of you inside a mirror, right? My co workers nudged me in to face my fears and in there I reached out to my mirror and placed my hand on it, making contact with what seemed to be just a regular mirror with my reflection inside of it. \n\nBut something felt weird about it, almost like a cold body had grazed my skin. I jump back from this, but I notice that “it” is grabbing my arm trying to suck me in. Just as I had feared, our mirrors do hold a secret. Maybe not one that anyone knows about, but I do. I may be one of the luckiest men in the world, but not too lucky. I was saved. \n\nMy friends came in to check my progress with facing my fears. And lucky for me, the demon or whatever the hell that “thing” really was pulled back. But my other friends weren’t as lucky they got pulled in by their own reflections out of nowhere. Now every day the sight of a mirror frightens me, I have removed every last mirror in my house but that face I will never forget here was a sketch I made of him. A face I will never forget.",
