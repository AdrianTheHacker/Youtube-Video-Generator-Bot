# Youtube-Video-Generator-Bot (Formerly Named Video-Audio-Combiner)

<br>[Last Updated August 23, 2023]

Over the past year I've seen many different channels on youtube upload simple shorts form videos that involved telling a story (often using text-to-speech bots) paired with background footage (usually a video game like Minecraft or Rocket League). I figured I could build a program to fully automate this process and allow users to grow a channel completely autonomously.

## Features
The table below indicates features of the project as well as both the projected time of completion and the actual time of completion.
