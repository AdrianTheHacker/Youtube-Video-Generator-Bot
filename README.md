# Youtube-Video-Generator-Bot (Formerly Named Video-Audio-Combiner)

<br>[Last Updated August 24, 2023]

Over the past year I've seen many different channels on youtube upload simple shorts form videos that involved telling a story (often using text-to-speech bots) paired with background footage (usually a video game like Minecraft or Rocket League). I figured I could build a program to fully automate this process and allow users to grow a channel completely autonomously.

## Core Features
The table below indicates features of the project as well as both the projected time of completion and the actual time of completion.

## Tools Used
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    * This was the primary coding language the project was built in.
2. [Pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
    * This was used for converting text from the Reddit posts into audio files.
3. [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)
    * This is a python library used for both editing videos, and audio.

# Old Project Vision
This is a program that combines audio to a video. The main goal of this project is to make a fully autonomous youtube bot to generate videos.
